 ### Setting the scene
 
 In the code below, a node that will show up as a hill is positioned to appear in the bottom left corner of the scene.
 
 A node that will show up as a boulder is positioned near the top left corner of the screen.
 
 Six nodes that will create a pyramid of crates are positioned at the bottom of the hill.
 
 And *yes indeed*, all of these graphics are drawn by Mr. Gordon – the "artist" who brought you the camelCase camel:
 
 ![camelCase](camelCase.jpeg)
 
 Run the code to see this scene.
 
 - Callout(Consider):
     What if we could have the boulder roll down the hill?

 ### Configuring Physics Bodies
 
 To allow nodes to interact with one another, we must define *bodies*, or edges, for the nodes.
 
 - Callout(Experiment):
 Remove the comments for each block of code below, one by one. Run the playground after each comment you remove. What happens?

 Remember that you can select a block of code by positioning your cursor at the left edge of the first line, then hold down the **Shift** key, then press the **↓** key.
  
 Once you have selected the block of code, press the **Command** and / keys at the same time to toggle the comments off all at once.
 
 */
// Add a physics body for the hill
hill.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(texture: hill.texture!,alphaThreshold: 0.5,size: hill.size)
hill.physicsBody?.isDynamic = false // Hill will not move (not impacted by physics)

// Add a physics body for the boulder
boulder.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(circleOfRadius: boulder.size.width * 0.5)

// Add a physics body for all nodes with identifier "one of the crates"
for node in scene.children {

    // Only look at nodes of type SKSpriteNode

 ### Other types of physics bodies
 
 The results at this point in our animation are less than optimal!
 
 A bit more about physics bodies. There are *multiple types* of physics bodies that can be used.
 
 The physics bodies added to the boulder, the hill, and the crates – they are **dynamic** physics bodies. Each body moves, is solid, has mass, can collide with any other type of physics body, and responds to forces – like gravity. Dynamic physics bodies are impacted by the physics engine – unless we tell the body not to be (like with the hill – look closely at the code around line 82).
 
 Do you see what's happening?
 
 We need to define another type of physics body.
 
 The **edge-loop** physics body is a *static*, volume-less physics body. As the name implies, this type of body defines only the edges of the shape. The body has no mass, cannot collide with other edge loop bodies, and is not moved by the physics engine (but can be moved by *actions* – more on that later).
 
 When you need a boundary for your game or animation – the ground, a wall – you will use an edge-loop body to define a collision area.

 - Callout(Experiment):
    Try uncommenting the section below.
 
    Now what happens?

 */

// Make an edge loop at the boundaries of the scene
scene.physicsBody = SKPhysicsBody(edgeLoopFrom: scene.frame)

 - Callout(Reflect):
     What type of animations could you imagine creating using the SpriteKit Physics engine? What types of games?
 
 ### Refining the Simulation
 
 The results of the boulder rolling down the hill are not quite true to life, yet.
 
 A boulder has a lot of mass.
 
 Wooden crates have mass, but not as much.
 
 The boulder should move the crates more!
 
 So how can we make this happen?
 
 The SKPhysicsBody class [has properties](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skphysicsbody) (see "Defining a Physics Body’s Physical Properties") that let you [set the characteristics of a physics body](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skphysicsbody/configuring_a_physics_body).
 
 - Experiment:
     Uncomment the block of code below that adjusts the mass of the boulder, so that when the boulder rolls down the hill, it achieves an apppropriate amount of destruction with the crates.
 
 */
// What is the current mass of a crate?
scene.childNode(withName: "one of the crates")?.physicsBody?.mass

// What is the current mass of the boulder?
boulder.physicsBody?.mass

// Change the boulder's mass
boulder.physicsBody?.mass = 0.05

/*:
 ### Changing the Direction of Gravity
 
 While it doesn't make much sense for this scenario, SpriteKit's physics engine is not limited to gravity always pulling "down" in a scene.
 
 - Experiment:
    Uncomment the block of code below.
 
    Run the playground.
 
    What happens?
 
    Once you've observed the results, comment the code out again, so that gravity pulls objects down, vertically, in the scene.
 
 */
// What is the current direction of gravity in the scene?
scene.physicsWorld.gravity

// Make gravity pull toward the left side of the scene
//scene.physicsWorld.gravity = CGVector(dx: -9.8, dy: 0)

 ### Exercises
 
 Read through the "Defining a Physics Body’s Physical Properties" section of [the `SKPhysicsBody` class](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/spritekit/skphysicsbody).
 
 1. It's not realistic, but try making the boulder extremely bouncy. Once you get this working, comment out the code for your answer before trying exercise 2.
 
 2. Try making the crates extremely bouncy as well. Refer to the block of code starting on line 88 for an example of how to adjust the properties of all the crates in an efficient manner. Once you get this working, comment out the code for your answer before trying exercise 3.
 
 3. Try adjusting the friction of the hill. Run the playground a few times with each new friction value you try. Note the difference in where the boulder ends up. Once you get this working, comment out the code for your answer before trying exercise 4.
 
 4. Make gravity pull objects upward in the scene.
